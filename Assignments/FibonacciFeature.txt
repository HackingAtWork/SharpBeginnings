Feature: Fibonacci recursion

Scenario 1: The one where we compute the first 5 fibonacci numbers
	Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
	When I ask for the first 5 numbers in the sequence
  Then the fib result set length should be 5
  And the fib set should contain 1
  And the fib set should contain 2
  And the fib set should contain 3
  And the fib set should contain 5

Scenario 2: The one where we find the fibonacci number of 1
	Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
  When I ask for the Fibonacci number of 1
  Then the fib result should be 1

Scenario 3: The one where we find the fibonacci number of 2
	Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
  When I ask for the Fibonacci number of 2
  Then the fib result should be 1

Scenario 4: The one where we find the fibonacci number of 3
	Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
  When I ask for the Fibonacci number of 3
  Then the fib result should be 2

Scenario 5: The one where we find the fibonacci number of 4
	Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
  When I ask for the Fibonacci number of 4
  Then the fib result should be 3
